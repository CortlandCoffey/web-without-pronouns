# Degender the Web - a Chrome extension

Inspired by [Farhad Manjoo](https://www.nytimes.com/by/farhad-manjoo)'s essay 
[It's Time for 'They'](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/pronoun-they-gender.html), 
_Degender the Web_ is a Chrome web browser extension that replaces all gendered pronouns with "they/them/their".

Gender-neutral pronouns added by this extension will appear with a faint dashed underline. Mouse over to see 
the original, gendered pronoun.

Over time, the singular pronoun "they", which is used by many people, should feel more natural in reading, writing, and speech.
