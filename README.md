"Degender the Web" is a Chrome web browser extension that replaces all gendered pronouns with "they/them/their".

The purpose is to normalize through continual exposure the use of the singular "they," 
preferred by many who do not adhere to the gender binary.

The inspiration is Farhad Manjoo's essay 
[Call Me 'They'](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/pronoun-they-gender.html), 
published in the _New York Times_ on July 10, 2019. 
Thanks to Kristen Peter Mork for bringing this essay to my attention.

This Chrome extension is also inspired by earlier word-replacement extensions such as 
[Honest Chrome](http://untitledscience.github.io/HonestChrome/), 
which replaces the body-shaming words "skinny", "slim", and "thin" with body-positive words 
"fit", "toned", and "healthy".
