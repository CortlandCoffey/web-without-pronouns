# Degender the Web - a Chrome extension

Inspired by [Farhad Manjoo](https://www.nytimes.com/by/farhad-manjoo)'s essay 
[It's Time for 'They'](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/pronoun-they-gender.html), 
_Degender the Web_ is a Chrome web browser extension that replaces all gendered pronouns with "they/them/their".

Gender-neutral pronouns added by this extension will appear with a faint dashed underline. Mouse over to see 
the original, gendered pronoun.

Over time, the singular pronoun "they", which is used by many people, should feel more natural in reading, writing, and speech.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Kristen Peter Mork for sharing Farhad Manjoo's essay. Thanks to many others for providing links (some names to appear soon). 

This Chrome extension is inspired by earlier Web browser extensions such as 
[HonestChrome](http://untitledscience.github.io/HonestChrome/), 
which replaces the "body-shaming" words "skinny", "slim", and "thin" with body-positive words 
"fit", "toned", and "healthy".

This work is supported by [Whitman College](https://www.whitman.edu/) and the Microsoft Chair in Computer Science. Thanks to Gillian Frew for assisting with media strategy.
