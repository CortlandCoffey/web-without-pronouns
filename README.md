Inspired by Jenna Glatzer's Facebook post of July 8, 2019:

>Friends who are writing about the Jeffrey Epstein case, please watch for these words:

> "underage women" -- there's no such thing. An underage woman is a child or girl.

> "child prostitute" -- children can't consent. They're rape victims, sexual assault victims, or survivors. Even if someone paid to assault them.

> "sex with [minors, girls, etc.]" -- it's rape. Call it rape.

> "non-consensual sex" is polite weasel-wording for "rape," and rapists don't deserve your politeness. Their victims deserve validation of what they've been through.
